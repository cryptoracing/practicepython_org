1. The script prompts the user to input a number. <br>
2. It generates a list of numbers ranging from 1 to the entered number. <br>
3. It iterates through each number in the list and checks if the entered number is divisible by it without any remainder. <br>
4. If it is, the number is added to a list of divisors. <br>
5. Finally, the script prints out the list of divisors.
