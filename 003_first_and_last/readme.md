The first_last function takes a list as input and returns a new list containing the first and last elements of the input list. If the input list is empty, it prints a message indicating that the list is empty.
Test Cases

The script provides test cases using three sample lists:

TEST_LIST = [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
TEST_LIST2 = [] (an empty list)
TEST_LIST3 = [1, 2, 5, 7]
